ðŸ”¢ Ordinal Encoding in Machine Learning:

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the Ordinal Encoding technique, which is used to convert categorical variables with a meaningful order into numerical format for machine learning models.

ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts Covered:

Understanding ordinal categorical features (e.g., low < medium < high)
Using OrdinalEncoder from Scikit-learn
Applying encoding to sample data
Comparing before and after transformation
Use case examples where ordinal encoding is appropriate

ðŸ›  Requirements:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, jupyter

ðŸ’¡ Ideal For:

Beginners learning about categorical data handling
Projects involving features with ordered categories
Preparing data for models that requireÂ numericÂ input
